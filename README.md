####Solving the travelling salesman problem with an evolutionary algorithm.

I've written evolutionary algorithms that solve for randomly generated bytes of strings. Let's see how effective it will be at the travelling salesman problem!

####Status: Mostly Complete

It's working! It is able to halve the distance travelled from 200 random generations in under 1000 iterations of the loop. The algorithm used is really just a mutation.
